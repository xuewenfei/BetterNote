  关于 BetterNote
</h3>

<div class="about">
  <p>
    BetterNote is a clone of <a href="http://www.evernote.com">Evernote</a>, the popular note-taking app, that was created by <a href="http://sweeneysam.com">Sam Sweeney</a> in Spring 2014.
  </p>
  <p>
    BetterNote was built using a Ruby on Rails back-end, a Backbone.js front-end, and a whole lot of love.  Much gratitude and admiration to the team at Evernote for making an awesome app that was also a blast to clone.
