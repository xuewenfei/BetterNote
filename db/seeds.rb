  title: "Albus Dumbledore's First Love",
  body: "Albus Dumbledore was having a decidedly unpleasant day. Ariana had blown up the kitchen and Aberforth was being unhelpful. Funnily enough this was not what had made the day so unpleasant. These occurrences were actually not abnormal. It was that infernal postcard from Doge. A lengthy letter detailing exactly all the things Albus was missing: Egypt, Rome, China. He should be there with his best friend exploring the world and extending his powers. Instead he was here playing house.

Albus sighed and sent Aberforth out, before proceeding in rebuilding the kitchen. Ariana fortunately was upstairs writing. She loved to write, silly poems and heart breaking stories. It was one of Kendra’s better ideas, to teach the girl to write. It helped her channel some of her inner torment onto the pages. Not that it had saved Kendra of course, but it was still a good idea. It took Albus the better part of an hour to assemble the kitchen properly. When he was finished he had meant to write an article for Potions Periodical, but he wanted some fresh air.

He dusted himself off and stepped into the front garden. He knew he couldn’t abandon Ariana alone in the house so he just sat on the front steps.

'Albus, can you come here a minute?' It was Bathilda Bagshot, Albus’s neighbor. Glad for the excuse, he stood up and walked over to his neighbor’s house. Bathilda was a soft looking middle-aged witch with mousy brow hair and charming smile. Albus knew better. That woman could be fierce. She was a famous magical historian and she had an odd knack of seeing past illusions. Now she stood in her doorway looking hopeful.",

  title: "The Slytherin Challenge",
  body: "Every Slytherin Head of House who ever was had been a Slytherin student. There were no exceptions to this nor would there ever be. And it was for one reason and only one reason, a most important reason that this was. Only the Head of House knew the Slytherin Challenge.

Ever since the Slytherin house had been in existence there had been the secret competition. The competition took place every year during the last full moon before school let out and all the seventh years graduated. It was held at midnight in the deepest, darkest dungeon of Hogwarts and only seventh year students were allowed to compete. They had to compete, whether they wanted to or not, for every Slytherin student who had ever lived had competed.

All of the lower years were sent to bed by the Student Head of House at a quarter to twelve. The seventh years waited in the common room, fully dressed with their wands in their pockets, until the stroke of midnight. The Head of House opened the portrait on the twelfth stroke and led the group down. The hallways were without candles or torches and were eerily silent as the students followed their trusted professor. As they traveled deeper and deeper into the castle the halls became cold and the students’ breath became visible. The students kept in a tight group, trying to hide their fear from one another. Not one among their solemn group had any clues of what was to come, for every alumni who had ever partook in this event was sworn to secrecy.

At last they stopped at the very end of the hall, the ground had ceased to be covered with bricks and was now no more than dirt. The doorway in front of them was flanked on either side by flaming torches. The door was large and strong. It was made entirely of steel and bore the Slytherin coat of arms; it had no locks or handles and would never budge without the key. The key was a sacred oath passed down from Salazar himself and had to be spoken in the strange tongue of the snakes, only then would the door slowly open, silent as a ghost.",

The din of a hundred different conversations echoed from the ancient stones that made up Castle Hogwarts. Several different strains of laughter could be made out coming from various directions. It was a happy cheerful noise. It was completely inappropriate to Cho’s mood.

'Are you okay, Cho?' asked a concerned voice.

Cho did not even turn to see who had asked, but simply nodded. She was so tired of people asking her that question. She was okay. She wasn’t good or great. She wasn’t bad or terrible. She was okay, and all things considered, that was more than enough. She really wanted to move on from all of this, but that simply would not be possible, until people stopped asking her whether or not she was okay.

She gazed around the Great Hall at her feasting schoolmates. They were joking, and laughing, and bringing their friends up to date on the experiences of summer. One might think, from their expressions, that absolutely nothing was wrong in the world. One might think that the previous year had ended just as every other year had ended. One might think that Cedric Diggory had not died. She did not have the luxury of that illusion. Every single ‘Are you okay?’ was just another reminder of that.",

  title: "Baked Falafel with Tahini Sauce",
  body: "Yield: 8 servings
Time: 45 minutes, plus up to 24 hours to soak chickpeas

1¾ cups dried chickpeas
2 garlic cloves, chopped
1 small onion, quartered
1 tablespoon cumin
Scant teaspoon cayenne, or to taste
1 cup chopped fresh parsley or cilantro
1½ teaspoons salt, plus more to taste
½ teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste
½ teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
4 tablespoons olive oil
½ cup tahini

1. Put the chickpeas in a large bowl and cover with water by 3 or 4 inches-the beans will triple in volume as they soak. Soak for 12 to 24 hours, checking once or twice to see if you need to add more water to keep the beans submerged. (If the soaking time is inconvenient for you, just leave them in the water until they’re ready; you should be able to break them apart between your fingers.)

2. Heat the oven to 375°F. Drain the chickpeas and transfer them to a food processor with the garlic, onion, cumin, cayenne, herb, 1 teaspoon of salt, pepper, baking soda, and lemon juice. Pulse until everything is minced but not pureed, stopping the machine and scraping down the sides if necessary; add water tablespoon by tablespoon if necessary to allow the machine to do its work, but keep the mixture as dry as possible. Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt, pepper, or cayenne as needed.

3. Grease a large rimmed baking sheet with 2 tablespoons of the oil. Roll the bean mixture into 20 balls, about 1½ inches each, then flatten them into thick patties. Put the falafel on the prepared pan and brush the tops with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Bake until golden all over, 10 to 15 minutes on each side.

4. Meanwhile, whisk the tahini and remaining salt with ½ cup water in a small bowl until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning and serve the falafel drizzled with the sauce.

Posted by Centaurious on Monday, 21/9/2009, 2.08 am
Tina Fey is an ugly, pear-shaped, bitchy, overrated troll

Dear Centaurious,

First let me say how inspiring it is that you have learned to use a computer.

I hate for our correspondence to be confrontational, but you have offended me deeply. To say I'm an overrated troll, when you have never even seen me guard a bridge, is patently unfair. I'll leave it for others to say if I'm the best, but I am certainly one of the most dedicated trolls guarding bridges today. I always ask three questions, at least two of which are riddles.

As for 'ugly, pear-shaped and bitchy'? I prefer the terms 'offbeat, business class–assed and exhausted', but I'll take what I can get. There's no such thing as bad press!

Now go to bed, you crazy night owl! You have to be at Nasa early in the morning. So they can look for your penis with the Hubble telescope.

Affectionately,
Tina

1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste
1 large yellow onion, chopped
3 stalks celery, chopped
1 green bell pepper, seeded and chopped
1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped

  body: "Yield: 4 servings
Time: About 1 hour

2 to 3 cups dried green lentils, washed and picked over
2 medium carrots, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1 small potato, peeled and cut into 1/4-inch cubes
1 medium onion, chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
A few sprigs each fresh parsley and thyme, a bay leaf, and a few chives, tied in cheesecloth for easy removal, or about 11/2 teaspoons mixed dried herbs
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Four 6-ounce salmon fillets
Chopped fresh parsley leaves or chives for garnish

Put the lentils in a large, deep saucepan with water to cover. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften, 15 to 20 minutes, then add the carrots, potato, onion, garlic, and herbs.
Continue to cook, adding just enough water if necessary to keep the beans moist, until the lentils and vegetables are tender, 35 to 45 minutes total. Remove the fresh herbs, sprinkle with salt and pepper, add the olive oil, and keep warm.
Heat a large skillet, preferably cast-iron, over high heat for about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the bottom of the skillet with salt, then add the salmon, skin side down. Cook over high heat until well browned on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip the salmon and cook for 1 minute longer (more if you like your salmon well done). Put about 1 cup of lentils in the center of each of 4 serving plates and top with a salmon fillet. Garnish with parsley and serve.

  title: "Braised Beef Short Ribs",
  body: "Ingredients:
12 beef short ribs, bone-in
Salt and freshly ground pepper
1/4 cup grapeseed oil or olive oil
1 yellow onion, peeled and chopped
1 stalk celery, chopped
1 carrot, peeled and chopped
1 750-ml bottle good dry red wine (we used a zinfandel)
6 cups veal stock (can substitute beef stock)

Directions:
1 Preheat oven to 350°F. Season ribs to taste with the salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large, heavy bottomed ovenproof pan over high heat. Add ribs and brown on all sides. Work in batches if you need to so that the ribs don't get crowded (this will help with browning).

2 Transfer ribs to a plate. Pour off excess fat. Add the onions, celery, and carrots to the pan and sauté, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the pan, set aside. Then add the wine to the pan, deglazing the pan, scraping off any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Reduce the wine by three-quarters until thick and slightly syrupy, about 15 minutes.

3 Return the ribs to the pan, add the veal stock and enough water to cover the ribs. Bring to a boil, cover with foil, and place in the oven. Braise, cooking in the oven, until the meat is fork-tender, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. During the last 1/2 hour of cooking, add back in the vegetables. Allow the ribs to cool in the liquid, then cover and refrigerate overnight.

4 The next day, remove the excess fat that has solidified at the top from the overnight chilling. Place the pan with the ribs and cooking liquid over medium heat, uncovered. Cook until the liquid has reduced by three-quarters, about 1 hour. Continue to cook, spooning the sauce over the ribs, until the sauce is thick and ribs are glazed. Take care not to burn the glaze; move the ribs around in the pan to keep them from burning.

Serve over mashed potatoes, egg noodles, or rice.

somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond
any experience,your eyes have their silence:
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
or which i cannot touch because they are too near

your slightest look easily will unclose me
though i have closed myself as fingers,
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose

or if your wish be to close me, i and
my life will shut very beautifully ,suddenly,
as when the heart of this flower imagines
the snow carefully everywhere descending;

nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
the power of your intense fragility:whose texture
compels me with the color of its countries,
rendering death and forever with each breathing

(i do not know what it is about you that closes
and opens;only something in me understands
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands",

8. I find that a duck’s opinion of me is very much influenced over whether or not I have bread.
7. In England, Smokey the Bear is not the forest fire prevention representative. They have Smacky the Frog. It’s a lot like a bear, but it’s a frog. I think that’s a better system. I think we should adopt it. Because bears can be mean, but frogs are always cool. Never has there been a frog hopping toward me, and I thought 'Man, I’d better play dead. Here comes that frog.' I would never say 'Here comes that frog' in a horrifying manner. It’s always, like, optimistic. Like, 'Hey, here comes that frog, all right. Maybe he will settle near me and I can pet him, and put him in a mayonnaise jar, with a stick and a leaf, to recreate what he’s used to.'
6. I had one anchovy. That’s why I didn’t have two anchovies.
5. My friend asked me if I wanted a frozen banana, but I said 'No… but I want a regular banana later, so yeah.'

  body: "Prep Time: 30 Minutes
Cook Time: 2 Hours 30 Minutes
Ready In: 3 Hours 15 Minutes
Servings: 12

Ingredients:
1 pound sweet Italian sausage
3/4 pound lean ground beef
1/2 cup minced onion
2 cloves garlic, crushed
1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes
2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste
2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce
1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons white sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
12 lasagna noodles
16 ounces ricotta cheese
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced
3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese

Directions:
1.	In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
2.	Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
3.	Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
4.	To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
5.	Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
